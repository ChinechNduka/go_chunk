    <p class="geting-started-description">A CSV file
        is a comma-separated values file commonly
        used by spreadsheet programs such as
        Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.<br>
        It contains plain text data sets separated
        by commas, with each new line in the CSV
        file representing a new database row and
        each database row consisting of one or more
        fields separated by a comma.
        Many data reporting tools output to CSV
        format.
    </p>
    <p class="geting-started-description-paragraph-text">A
        JSON file is a file that stores simple data
        structures and objects in JavaScript Object
        Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard
        data interchange format. It is primarily
        used for transmitting data between a web
        application and a server.
        JSON files are lightweight, text-based,
        human-readable, and can be edited using a
        text editor.
        From APIs to configuration files, JSON is
        now everywhere.

    <p class="geting-started-description">
        It is expected that users already have their
        large files which they want to split/chunk.
        For now, our website offers chunking for
        only CSV/JSON formats. In the next versions,
        we will make provision for other file
        formats.
