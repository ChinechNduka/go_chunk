		Chunking is Done</h1>
	<div class="list-items">
		<p>First of all, we created a model
			(sometimes called database schema) that
			accept
			the user’s information for signup and
			also the model for receiving the file
			which
			needs to chunked.
			For each file chunked it is referenced
			to the user itself to prevent other
			users from
			seeing it. Files not saved will be
			deleted after the speculated time given.
			The process of chunking a file goes like
			this.

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The User import the file into the
				dropbox, with the maximum row number
				the
				user want in a file.</li>
			<li>The store file function reads
				through
				the imported file, split it by the
				maximum
				row number into each new file
				created
				then saves all the chunked files in
				a
				zip folder.</li>

			<li> If the user decides to save the
				file, it
				goes into the media folder.</li>
			<li> If not saved, it goes into the
				temporary
				folder and get deleted after 15 mins
				of
				creation.</li>
			<li> For the user to review just one
				file, a
				standalone file will be created to
				see
				how it’s being chunked</li>
		</ul>
